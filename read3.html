    <h2> Introduction </h2>
                <p> 
                    India's space agency, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), is all set to embark on its third moon mission, Chandrayaan-3. This highly anticipated mission aims to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface, following the unsuccessful attempt of its predecessor, Chandrayaan-2. With Chandrayaan-3, India hopes to join the elite group of nations that have successfully accomplished a lunar landing. In this article, we will delve into the latest updates on Chandrayaan-3, its orbital maneuvers, and its significance in India's space exploration journey.

                 <h2> Chandrayaan-3's Path to the Moon </h2>
                <p>
                    Chandrayaan-3 was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota on a powerful LVM-3 rocket. After escaping Earth's orbit, the spacecraft will gradually move into the Moon's orbital path, pulled by the lunar gravity. By the first week of August, Chandrayaan-3 is expected to reach the lunar orbit, approximately 100 km from the lunar surface. At this stage, the spacecraft will scan the environment to determine a suitable landing site on the south pole of the Moon. The final descent and soft landing are scheduled for August 23, 2023.
                </p>

                <h2>  Orbital Maneuvers and Progress  </h2>
                <p> 
                    To ensure a successful landing, ISRO is conducting a series of orbit-raising maneuvers. These maneuvers involve gradually raising the spacecraft's orbit until it reaches a circular orbit around 100 km from the lunar surface. The fourth orbit-raising maneuver was completed on July 14, and the next maneuver is planned for July 25 between 2 pm and 3 pm. These maneuvers are crucial for positioning the spacecraft and aligning it with the intended landing site.

                <h2> Learning from Chandrayaan-2 </h2>
                <p>
                    Chandrayaan-3 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, Chandrayaan-2, which unfortunately experienced a setback in September 2019 when it failed to achieve a soft landing on the lunar surface. However, the lessons learned from Chandrayaan-2 have been instrumental in refining the design and mission objectives of Chandrayaan-3. The main goals of this mission are to demonstrate end-to-end capability in safe landing and roving on the lunar surface.
                </p>
                <h2> The Significance of Soft Landing </h2>
                <p>
                    A successful soft landing on the Moon would mark a significant milestone for India's space exploration program. Currently, only three nations have achieved this feat: the United States, the former Soviet Union, and China. By joining this exclusive group, India would solidify its position as a frontrunner in space exploration and showcase its technological prowess to the world.

                <h2>The Journey Ahead </h2>
                <p>
                    As Chandrayaan-3 progresses towards its final destination, ISRO is closely monitoring its trajectory and making necessary adjustments. Earth-bound maneuvers will continue until July 31, after which the spacecraft will enter the lunar orbit around August 1. The next few weeks will be critical as Chandrayaan-3 prepares for its historic landing on the lunar surface.
                </p>
                <h2> Conclusion</h2>
                <p> 
                    Chandrayaan-3 represents India's determination to conquer new frontiers in space exploration. With its advanced technology and meticulous planning, ISRO aims to achieve a successful soft landing on the Moon's south pole. The mission's progress and developments are closely followed by space enthusiasts worldwide, eagerly awaiting India's entry into the elite group of nations that have accomplished a lunar landing. As August 23 approaches, the world holds its breath in anticipation of Chandrayaan-3's historic touchdown on the lunar surface.
